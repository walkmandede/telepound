If youâ€™re a Flutter developer, love the Dart programming language, and have an urge to develop web server applications using Dart, I would like to share that you can now do so with the power of the Dart Frog web server framework and Globe deployment platform, especially for Dart servers.

The goal of Dart Frog is to help developers effectively build backends in Dart. Dart Frog provides a simple core with a small API surface area to reduce the learning curve and ramp-up time for developers. Additionally, Dart Frog is designed to help Flutter/Dart developers maximize their productivity by offering a unified tech stack that enables sharing tooling, models, and more!

Globe is a deployment platform for Dart developers that allows you to deploy your Dart backend, frontend, and Flutter web applications to a globally distributed service without the need to manage servers, networks, or scaling. The core principle of Globe is a simplified deployment service with a great developer experience in mind.
